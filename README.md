# Build a Neural Network in Julia
A fully-connected, feedforward, neural network using Stochastic Gradient Descent. Written in Julia. 

## Quick Use
First install Julia on your local machine (e.g. Windows, OSX, or Linux). WSL2 does not work due to issues with plotting the average losses for each epoch. 
```bash 
$ julia requirements.jl
$ julia main.jl
```
